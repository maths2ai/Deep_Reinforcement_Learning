# Introduction 

This folder is meant to contain some of the more recent Reinforcement Learning codes that I intend to use for my research.
At the moment, just R2D2 is contained. Notice that the code runs, but it includes some problems due to the prioritized experience buffer and the hyperparameters' tuning. 
Indeed, these latter are set considering a parallelization of the environment, which it is not contained here.

# Next Steps

In the next 2 months I plan to upload in PyTorch the following codes:

I will surely
1) "Go-Explore"
2) "Learning Montezuma Revenge from a Single Demostration"

Also I am gonna fine tune the hyperparameters of R2D2.

I will likely upload
1) Neural Episodic Control
2) "Random Network Distillation"
3) "Never Give Up"

Therefore if you are interested keep visiting this page.
