# Introduction

Noisy DQN is a DQN extension where the explorations is encoded inside the linear layers of the agent. A mean and a standard deviation for each layer is learned. 
The weight of the linear layer is then set equal to the sampled mean plus the sampled standard deviation which is multiplied by a random noise.
