# Introduction

This is my implementation of Categorical DQN. Part of the code is inspired by the Higgsfield repository on Deep Reinforcement Learning.
I will try to comment more on the common parts between my code and Higgsfield's one. 

The code has been written as an exercise for D4PG, which I need for a project.
